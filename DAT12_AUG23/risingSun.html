                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Started by Elon Musk in 2003, Tesla is an American all-electric car manufacturer that has been on a growth spree for the past decade. The company's first car, the Tesla Roadster, was introduced in 2008 to showcase the capabilities of an all-electric car. The Roadster used the bodyshell of the Lotus Elise sports car and came with an all-electric battery pack that was claimed to deliver a range of 200 miles (around 320km). Later, Tesla launched its first completely in-house developed car - the Model S sedan in 2012, and followed it with the Model X SUV in 2015, while expanding its footprint in the global passenger market. The most affordable Tesla, the Model 3, was unveiled in 2017 and is currently in high demand, with a waiting period of around 12 months.
