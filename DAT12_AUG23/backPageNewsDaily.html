                            We smoked cigarettes man no regrets.

                            We've taken different paths.
                            And travelled different roads.
                            I know we'll always end up on the same one when we're old
                            And when you're in the trenches.
                            And you're under fire I will cover you
                            If I was dying on my knees.
                            You would be the one to rescue me
                            And if you were drowned at sea.
                            I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe.
